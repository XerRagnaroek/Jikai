# Jikai (æ¬¡å›ž)
Jikai is a discord bot made using [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and parsing all its anime data from [AniList](https://anilist.co/) (*not affiliated in any way!*).
Its main purpose is to allow users to subscribe to currently airing anime and be notified when a new episode releases or anything changes.

## Features
### Centralised lists for the three title languages
You can change you subscriptions here, simply by reacting with the respective emoji!

### Links to streaming sites
So far only Gogoanime links are supported (because it's the site I use). Other services such as Proxer and KickAssAnime will be added in future updates.

### Tracking of unwatched episodes
Never lose track of episodes you haven't watched yet! Jikai can tell you which eps you're still missing, including links to their release messages and streaming links.
When you've watched an episode, just click on ðŸ‘€ to mark is as such!

### Daily overview of your anime

### Integration with your AniList account
You can link your AniList account with Jikai!
So far Jikai only checks your *Watching* and *Planning* lists and syncs your subs with them.
It is planned to also update these lists when you sub or unsub using Jikai (but I couldn't be bothered with OAuth yet).

### Sharing and linking subscriptions with other users
Every user has a unique export key that can be used to share their subs or link them to other users.
Linking subs means that whenever the link target subscribes, you'll also be subscribed to that anime. This can be done both ways, perfect for watching and planning a season with a friend!
The subscription list also allows you to sub and unsub directly, no need to go to the big list!

### Lots of configurable options
You can set your timezone for localised dates and times, your notification times up to a week, Jikai's language and enable or disable any feature you don't like!
